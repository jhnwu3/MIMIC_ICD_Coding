# Repository for Easy Dataloading for the Clinical Free Text to ICD Coding Translation Task.
Inspired by the ICD Coding Preprocessors sourced from [here](https://github.com/JoakimEdin/medical-coding-reproducibility).

Please make sure to unzip all of the csv files once you have MIMICIII downloaded from [physionet](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/) (note that you will need to finish some privacy training and make an account to get access).

We offer 3 different ICD coding tasks:
1. MIMIC-III Clean 
2. MIMIC-IV ICD9 (In Progress)
3. MIMIC-IV ICD10 (In Progress)

We offer an example notebook on how to use the dataset in example_mimic3.ipynb.
